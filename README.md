## Overview
### Description
You are what you do every day. Our application focuses on the building blocks of skill - routines. Perfect your daily routine, share your success with your friends, and tweak your routines into perfection. Friends can view your progress and help hold you accountable!

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking / Productivity
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile
- **Story:** Promotes the creation of user habits through a miniaturized task-based structure. Tasks are aggregated over time to create a sense of progression for the user, and task completion is tracked daily through journals.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would have to add their friends
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on habits they want to improve or helping their friends keep their goal. 
- **Scope:** This app is a short term task list to encourage productivity without unnecessary engagement. There are no plans to add a large feature list currently. By keeping the features limited the app will stayed focused on its intended use.

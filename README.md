- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, and to keep it a safe environment, people would have to add their friends
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on habits they want to improve or helping their friends keep their goal. 
- **Scope:** This app is a short term task list to encourage productivity without unnecessary engagement. There are no plans to add a large feature list currently. By keeping the features limited the app will stayed focused on its intended use.
